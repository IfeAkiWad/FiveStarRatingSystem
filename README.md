# Five Star Rating System
This was an assessment I had to do for a company I was applying for. I wanted to continue to tackle it after the alotted time was up.

## Goal
Implement a 5-star rating system (like you would use on Yelp or Uber). When you click on one of the stars, it will fill that star and all the stars up until that one (i.e. when you select the third star, the first, second, and third stars become filled).

### Requirements
1. Displays 5 empty stars.
2. When you click on a star, it will fill that star and all the stars up until that one. The remaining stars stay empty.
3. When the user hovers over a star, it will fill or highlight that star and all the stars up until that one.
4. When the user clicks the same star twice, it resets the selected stars.

## Running Locally
1. The assessment requires Node 10Â LTS or above. You can download & install Node.JS [here](nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Install dependencies, run `npm install` in your terminal.
3. Run the app, run `npm start` in your terminal.
4. Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Making Changes
The browser should automatically reload whenever you save your changes. However, if the browser is not automatically reloading, sometimes a page refresh is needed.

Feel free to refactor `src/App.js`. You can use it as guidance but don't feel obligated to keep or use any of the code that is currently there.

## Committing Changes
1. Use `git` to commit your changes by running `git add <filename>` then `git commit <filename>` in your terminal. 

2. Push your changes back up to HackerRank by running `git push` in your terminal.
